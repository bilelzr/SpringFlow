# SpringFlow
The project is a Spring Boot-based API application that provides a simple and efficient way to build RESTful services. It incorporates various DevOps tools and technologies to streamline the development, deployment, and monitoring processes.

The application is deployed using Jenkins, a popular automation server, which enables continuous integration and delivery. Jenkins automates the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring a smooth and efficient workflow.

The artifact repository, Nexus, is used to store and manage the application's dependencies, ensuring their availability and version control. Nexus simplifies the management of binary artifacts and facilitates their deployment and distribution.

To monitor the application's performance and health, Prometheus and Grafana are integrated. Prometheus collects metrics and data from the running application, while Grafana provides a visual representation of these metrics through customizable dashboards. This combination allows for effective monitoring and analysis of the application's behavior.

In summary, this project combines the power of Spring Boot for building APIs, Jenkins for automated deployment, Nexus for artifact management, and Prometheus with Grafana for comprehensive monitoring. The result is a robust and efficient system that streamlines the development and deployment lifecycle while providing valuable insights into the application's performance.
